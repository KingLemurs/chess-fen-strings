One big challenge I had was learning bitboards / bit manipulation magic in general, but once I got a hold of it I can see myself using it a LOT more in the future with other projects. I'm eager to see how far I can push the bot with the optimizations described in lectures.

I got to depth 5, the AI plays pretty well to me, but I'm also really bad at chess so I dunno how well that translates.
